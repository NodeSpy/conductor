# Agent isolation & sandboxing

Locally-dispatched agents historically ran as the same OS user as the
daemon — a sibling agent could read another's process table, files, and fds.
The `isolation:` block closes that: per-dispatch isolation for the runtimes
conductor launches itself, plus a conductor-enforced network egress
allowlist. (#36 §15.)

## Where it applies

`isolation:` can be set at three scopes:

| Scope | Applies to | Wins |
|---|---|---|
| `agents.<name>.isolation` | that profile's launches | most specific |
| `runtimes.<name>.isolation` | every launch of that runtime | fallback |
| `hosts.<name>.isolation` | every script that SSH host runs | independent |

It only applies to launches conductor performs itself: **acp**, **cli**,
**opencode**, and **agent-deck** runtimes, and `hosts:` scripts (code steps,
remote commands). A **paseo** runtime's agents are children of the paseo
daemon — conductor never holds that process, so `conductor validate` rejects
`isolation:` on paseo runtimes and on profiles that resolve to one, rather
than silently not isolating. Use paseo's own sandboxing there, or move the
profile to a runtime conductor launches.

## Code-step engines (sandboxed by default)

Connectors and runtimes follow the app-extension model: a plugin you added is
trusted, so with no `isolation:` block it runs under its permission manifest +
scrubbed env, not an OS jail. **Code-step ENGINES are the exception.** A `run: js`
step executes arbitrary code and the engine declares no capabilities, so
conductor sandboxes engine plugins **by default** — a `namespace`-mode sandbox
with the network denied. Tune or opt out per engine with the top-level
`engines:` block, keyed by engine name:

```yaml
engines:
  js:   {}                                             # default: sandboxed (namespace, network denied)
  lua:  { trust: full }                                # opt OUT — run unconfined (an engine you've audited)
  wasm: { isolation: { mode: user, user: sandbox } }   # explicit override (fail-closed)
```

The synthesized default is **best-effort**: where the OS sandbox can't be applied
(non-Linux, running as root, or `unshare` / unprivileged user namespaces
unavailable) the engine runs with a loud warning rather than failing — a code
engine that worked yesterday keeps working. An explicit `isolation:` block is
**fail-closed**, like everywhere else. Daemon-path masking is not part of the
default (an unprivileged `unshare` cannot reliably overmount the state/config
dirs), so the default leans on the network + pid namespaces — enough to confine a
pure-compute engine (no egress, no view of other processes); use an explicit
`isolation:` (or `mode: container`) if you need filesystem masking too.

## Modes

```yaml
x-templates:
  risky-fixer: &risky-fixer
    type: agent
    runtime: gemini
    isolation:
      mode: user | namespace | container
      user: sandboxagent                  # mode: user
      container: { image: agents:latest, engine: docker }  # mode: container
      limits: { memory: 2g, cpu: 200%, pids: 256 }
      network:
        egress: [ "api.github.com:443", "*.internal:443" ]
        deny: true    # + egress ⇒ ENFORCED allowlist (namespace/container);
                      # alone ⇒ structural no-network; absent ⇒ advisory proxy
      fs: [ "/srv/media" ]  # filesystem allow-list: extra paths the sandbox may
                            # see (namespace = a real pivot_root jail; container
                            # = -v binds). Empty ⇒ just the workdir.
      # privileged: true   # namespace mode: opt back into the daemon's full
      #                    # filesystem view (state/config masked by default)
      # allow_root: true   # namespace mode: run the sandbox even when the
      #                    # daemon is root (NOT a boundary then — see below)
```

### `mode: user` — a distinct low-privilege user

The launch is wrapped in `sudo -n -u <user> --`. Works on any Unix; the
conductor user needs a sudoers rule like:

```
conductor ALL=(sandboxagent) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

The sandbox user should own nothing but its own scratch space; the worktree
must be readable/writable by it (group membership or ACLs).

**Honest scope — what `mode: user` does and doesn't give you.**
It isolates the agent **from the daemon** (different uid → no reading
conductor's state, config, or memory). It does **not** isolate concurrent
dispatches **from each other** when they share the account: same EUID means
a sibling agent can read `/proc/<pid>/environ` (tokens included) and
signal/ptrace its peers. And any `egress:` allowlist under `mode: user` is
**advisory-only** — there's no network namespace, so only the proxy env
steers traffic; a runtime that ignores `HTTP(S)_PROXY` reaches the network
directly. `conductor validate` warns on both. For agent-vs-agent isolation
give each concurrent scope its own `user:`, or use `namespace`/`container`;
for an enforced allowlist use `deny: true` + `egress:` under
`namespace`/`container`.

One combination is refused outright (no override): a `skill:` profile whose
effective isolation is `mode: user`. The skill's one-shot claim code rides
the tool server's environment, and same-EUID siblings can read it from
`/proc/<pid>/environ` and race the claim — re-opening the broker-identity
hijack the claim flow exists to close. Use `namespace`/`container` (separate
`/proc` views) with `skill:`, or drop one of the two.

### `mode: namespace` — the OS-native least-privilege jail

`mode: namespace` is **portable**: it means "the OS's native least-privilege
jail", and conductor picks the backend by OS — **Linux user namespaces** here,
**macOS Seatbelt** (`sandbox-exec`) on a Mac. The config surface is identical
(`network:` / `fs:`), so the same YAML — including the confined-by-default a
pack gets — works on both; see [[#macos-seatbelt]] below for what differs. The
rest of this section describes the Linux backend.

The launch is wrapped in
`unshare --user --map-current-user --pid --fork --mount-proc --kill-child`:
its own user/pid/mount namespaces, so it cannot see sibling process tables
or `/proc/<pid>/environ` of other agents. With `limits:` set, a
`systemd-run --user --scope` prefix applies cgroup caps (`MemoryMax`,
`CPUQuota`, `TasksMax`). `network: {deny: true}` adds `--net`: the agent has
no network interface but loopback in an empty namespace — structural.

**Filesystem — two shapes.** A namespace keeps the daemon's own uid, so file
permissions alone would let the launch read everything the daemon can.
Conductor closes that off in one of two ways:

- **CODE steps (`use: cli`/`command:`, `run: <interpreter>`) get a real
  filesystem JAIL.** The launch is re-entered through conductor's own helper,
  which builds a fresh root, bind-mounts in **only** the allow-list — the
  workdir, the interpreter essentials (`/usr`, `/etc`, `/bin`…, read-only), a
  private `/proc` + `/dev` + `/tmp`, the step's own code/ctx sockets, and any
  `fs:` paths you declare — and `pivot_root`s into it. Everything else on the
  host, the daemon's state/config/secrets included, is **gone by absence** (not
  merely masked). The privilege that lets it mount is dropped before your code
  runs, so the code cannot pivot back out. This is a bwrap-style jail with **no
  docker required**; declare the paths a step legitimately needs with `fs:`.
- **Runtime/plugin launches** (an agent runtime's own process) instead **mask
  the daemon's state and config directories** (empty read-only tmpfs over
  directories, `/dev/null` over files); `privileged: true` opts out. Here the
  rest of the daemon's uid view (its `$HOME`, other repos) is still visible —
  for a full jail on a runtime launch, use `mode: container` or `mode: user`.

A confinement that can't be applied fails the launch rather than running
unconfined — except a pack's *synthesized* default (below), which degrades
with a warning so a pack still runs on a box without namespaces.

`isolation: { mode: namespace, privileged: true }` is the deliberate
opt-in to the daemon's full filesystem view (no masking) — for a trusted
profile that genuinely needs the daemon's own files. It's the same
philosophy as `trust: full`: the strong posture is the default, the
footgun is explicit. Remote (`hosts:`) namespace wraps never mask (the
helper binary lives on this box) — the remote box's own account setup is
the wall there.

**Never a boundary as root — refused by default.** `--map-current-user` maps
the daemon's own uid into the new user namespace. When the daemon runs as
**root (euid 0)** that mapping is root→root: the sandboxed agent keeps real
uid 0 and full `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` over the host, so the user namespace confers
**no privilege separation at all** — masks, `--net`, and cgroup limits become
things a root agent can simply undo. Conductor therefore **refuses a
namespace-mode launch when euid is 0** with an error pointing you at a
non-root daemon user or `mode: container`. Run conductor as a dedicated
non-root user (the intended posture), or switch that profile to
`mode: container`.

`isolation: { mode: namespace, allow_root: true }` is the deliberate opt-in
to run the namespace sandbox as root anyway — valid **only** when you are
using the namespace for process/mount cleanup or cgroup limits and are **not**
relying on it as a security wall against the agent. Same philosophy as
`privileged:` and `trust: full`: strong-by-default, footgun explicit. It
applies to namespace mode only (`validate` rejects it elsewhere as a no-op).

The Linux backend needs user namespaces + `pivot_root`; the macOS backend
(below) needs `sandbox-exec`. On any other platform `conductor validate`
rejects `mode: namespace` (a remote `hosts:` entry skips the local check — the
remote box's OS applies).

#### macOS — Seatbelt {#macos-seatbelt}

On a Mac the same `mode: namespace` is realized by **Seatbelt**, Apple's kernel
sandbox, via `sandbox-exec -p <profile>` (shipped on every Mac; no root, no
Docker). conductor generates a deny-by-default SBPL profile from the SAME
allow-list the Linux jail uses:

- `(deny default)` → the daemon's config/state/secrets are unreadable (the
  macOS form of "hidden by absence" — deny-default denies metadata too, so
  `stat` is refused, not just reads).
- each `fs:` path + the workdir → `(allow file-read* file-write* (subpath …))`;
  the step's own code/ctx temp dirs are added read-only/read-write for you.
- `network: {deny: true}` → `(deny network*)`; open/advisory → `(allow
  network*)` (the advisory `HTTP(S)_PROXY` still steers a well-behaved runtime).

Two differences from Linux, both enforced at `validate`:

- **cgroup `limits:` are ignored** on macOS (no systemd/cgroups analog).
- **An enforced egress allowlist (`deny: true` + `egress:`) is Linux-only** —
  Seatbelt can cut the network wholesale but not run the in-sandbox forwarder.
  On macOS use `mode: container` for an enforced allowlist, or plain
  `deny: true` / an advisory `egress:` without `deny`.

Seatbelt is a kernel sandbox, not a uid trick, so the "not a boundary as root"
caveat does not apply on macOS.

### `mode: container` — docker / podman

The launch becomes `docker run --rm -i -v <worktree>:<worktree> -w <worktree> …`
(engine `podman` selectable). The image must carry the runtime binary the
launch expects (e.g. `claude`, `gemini`). `deny: true` becomes
`--network=none`; `limits:` map to `--memory/--cpus/--pids-limit`. The
identity env is passed through with `-e KEY` — the daemon's own environment
is **not** forwarded into the container. Not supported for remote (`host:`)
launches — configure it on that box's own conductor.

## The egress allowlist (conductor-enforced)

A `network:` block routes the launched runtime's HTTP(S) traffic through a
loopback forward proxy **inside conductor's own process**:

- `egress: [ "api.github.com:443", "*.internal", "10.0.0.7:8443" ]` —
  CONNECT tunnels and plain-HTTP proxy requests are matched against the
  patterns (`host`, `host:port`, `host:*`, glob on the host half). A bare
  host means **:443 only** (the safe default); any other port needs an
  explicit `host:port`, and `host:*` is the deliberate any-port opt-in.
  Non-matching targets get a 403 and an `egress_denied` audit record.
- `network: {}` (present but empty) — deny-all: every egress attempt is
  refused and audited.
- The launch env gets `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` (and lowercase) pointing at
  the proxy **with a per-dispatch credential** in the URL;
  `NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost,::1` keeps conductor's own local surfaces
  (the skill socket, a local opencode server) reachable.
- The proxy **requires that credential** (`Proxy-Authorization`): it's a
  host-wide loopback listener, so without auth any local process could ride
  an allowlisted profile's egress. Unauthenticated clients get 407 before
  any target matching; the credential is stripped before anything leaves the
  box.

**Deny by default for agent-authored work:** a dispatch that came from an
agent-authored plan (§11) is routed through the deny-all proxy even with no
`isolation:` configured at all. An explicit `network.egress:` on the profile
opts specific targets back in; `trust` doesn't change this — only config
does.

### Enforced vs. advisory

The allowlist has two strengths, and the strong one is what you should
reach for:

- **Enforced — `deny: true` + `egress:` under `namespace`/`container`.**
  The sandbox's network is removed structurally (`unshare --net` /
  `--network=none`); the launch is re-entered through `conductor
  sandbox-net`, an in-sandbox forwarder that pipes into conductor's
  filtering proxy over a **unix socket** (a filesystem object — it crosses
  the namespace boundary; nothing else does). The runtime's
  `HTTP(S)_PROXY` points at the forwarder's in-sandbox loopback address,
  reachable from inside and nowhere else. A runtime that ignores proxy env
  reaches **nothing**: there is no interface, no route, and no DNS — the
  proxy resolves CONNECT targets itself outside the sandbox, so
  DNS-tunnel exfiltration is closed with the rest. The allowlist is an OS
  boundary. (Container mode bind-mounts conductor's own static binary and
  the socket into the container; same-architecture image required.)
- **Advisory — `egress:` under `mode: user` (or without `deny`).** Only
  the proxy env steers traffic; a runtime that ignores `HTTP(S)_PROXY`
  can still reach the network directly. `conductor validate` says so out
  loud. Use it for audit/visibility, not as a boundary — and prefer the
  enforced form whenever the profile runs on this box.

Plain `deny: true` (no list) remains the full structural cutoff. `deny:
true` in any form is rejected for opencode runtimes (it would sever
conductor's own HTTP control channel — use `network: {}` instead), and an
`egress:` list needs a local launch (the proxy lives on this box; use
plain `deny: true` with namespace mode on a remote host).

## Hosts

```yaml
hosts:
  sandbox:
    host: sandbox.internal
    user: ci
    isolation: { mode: user, user: agents }
```

Every script that host runs — including agent-authored code forced onto it
by `policy.agent_authored.host` — executes wrapped
(`sudo -n -u agents -- sh -c '…'`) on the remote box. Modes `user` and
`namespace` only; the egress proxy lives on the daemon's box and doesn't
reach remote launches (validation rejects a remote `egress:` list — use
`deny: true` with namespace mode there).

A host named by `policy.agent_authored.host` **must carry an `isolation:`
block** — a "sandbox" host that doesn't isolate is a plain remote shell
wearing the name, so `conductor validate` rejects the combination.
`agent_authored: { trust: full }` is the documented opt-out: the same knob
that lifts the allow/approve/host gates lifts this requirement.

## Degradation

| Situation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `mode: namespace` on macOS/Windows | rejected by `validate` (local) / launch error with a clear message |
| `mode: namespace` while daemon is root (euid 0) | launch refused (not a boundary as root) unless `allow_root: true` |
| `sudo` / `unshare` / `docker` missing | launch fails with "needs X on PATH", never silently unisolated |
| egress policy with no proxy wired | launch fails closed |
| enforced egress with no unix endpoint wired | launch fails closed |
| a default filesystem mask can't be applied | launch fails, never runs unmasked |
| isolation on a paseo runtime | rejected by `validate` |
| `skill:` + `mode: user` isolation | rejected by `validate` (claim theft under a shared uid) |
| `agent_authored.host` without `isolation:` | rejected by `validate` (`trust: full` opts out) |

## Audit

Every denied egress attempt is logged and audited as
`{event: egress_denied, target: host:port}`, so a sandboxed agent probing
the network is visible in `conductor report`'s audit trail.
